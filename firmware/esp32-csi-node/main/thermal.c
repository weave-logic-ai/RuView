/* On-chip thermal monitoring and radio throttling.
 *
 * The ESP32-C6 carries a temperature sensor (SOC_TEMP_SENSOR_SUPPORTED) that
 * nothing in this firmware has ever read. That was tolerable on a bare board
 * on a bench; it is not once nine nodes are sealed in printed enclosures and
 * left on a wall for months with the radio transmitting continuously.
 *
 * What we are protecting is the enclosure, not the silicon. The part is rated
 * well past anything it will see here, but PLA goes soft at its glass
 * transition around 55-60 C -- and that is sagging under its own weight over
 * weeks, not a dramatic failure, so it would never announce itself.
 *
 * The sensor reads DIE temperature, which runs hotter than the plastic around
 * it. Thresholds are therefore set against the die with that offset in mind:
 * a die at ~72 C in a small vented box is roughly a 50-55 C enclosure, which
 * is where PLA starts to matter. They are deliberately not set at 55 C -- that
 * would throttle a perfectly healthy node.
 *
 * Throttling reduces WiFi transmit power, which is the dominant heat source
 * and degrades gracefully: links weaken but keep working, where cutting the
 * capture rate would blind the node entirely.
 *
 * IMPORTANT for anyone reading link diagnostics: a throttled node's RSSI drops
 * at both ends, which looks exactly like an obstruction. `thermal_state()` and
 * `thermal_tx_dbm()` exist so that can be distinguished from a cage or a wall
 * rather than misdiagnosed as one.
