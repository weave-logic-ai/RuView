/**
 * Decide the next thermal state from a reading and the current state.
 *
 * Pure: no globals, no hardware. Kept in the public header so a host test can
 * exercise the exact function the device build runs, rather than a copy of it
 * that is free to drift.
 *
 * Rising edges act immediately -- heat is a reason to react now. EVERY falling
 * edge requires cooling a full `hyst_c` below the threshold that was crossed on
 * the way up, because recovering at the same point that tripped oscillates, and
 * each oscillation steps this node's transmit power, which moves the RSSI of
 * every link it has. A reader cannot distinguish that from a wall moving.
 *
 * The CRITICAL -> THROTTLED edge is the reason this exists as a function. It
 * used to be unconditional: any reading below `critical_c` dropped the state
 * immediately, so a node sitting on the critical boundary flapped between
 * minimum and step-2 transmit power indefinitely -- precisely the oscillation
 * the hysteresis elsewhere was added to prevent. With defaults (critical 80,
 * hysteresis 8) leaving CRITICAL now needs 72 C, which is exactly the THROTTLED
 * entry point.
 *
 * @param cur         Current state.
 * @param c           Die temperature, degrees C.
 * @param warn_c      Warn threshold.
 * @param throttle_c  Throttle threshold.
 * @param critical_c  Critical threshold.
 * @param hyst_c      Degrees of cooling required before any step down.
 * @return The state to adopt.
