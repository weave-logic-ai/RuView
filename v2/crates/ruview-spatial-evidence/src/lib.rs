//! # `ruview-spatial-evidence` — RuView output as `spatial.evidence.v1` JSONL
//!
//! `spatial.evidence.v1` is the versioned, one-record-per-line wire format
//! of the WeftOS spatial evidence engine (WeftOS ADR-107 §7). This crate is
//! the RuView-side emitter for the two RF record types RuView can produce:
//!
//! - [`gaussian`]: `ruview_unified` [`RfGaussian`](ruview_unified::gaussian::RfGaussian)s
//!   (one by one or a whole [`GaussianMap`](ruview_unified::gaussian::GaussianMap))
//!   become `rf_gaussian` records.
//! - [`link`]: a TX/RX link with a measured and a free-space amplitude
//!   becomes an `rf_link_observation` record carrying `excess_loss_db`.
//!
//! The wire shapes live in [`wire`] as local serde structs. Nothing here
//! depends on WeftOS: the contract is the JSON, not a shared crate.
//! Every record is validated against the v1 rules before it is serialised
//! ([`to_line`]), so a bad value fails here rather than in the consumer.
//!
//! ## Proof tags
//!
//! Each record carries `provenance.proof` (`MEASURED` / `CODE` /
//! `SYNTHETIC`). A Gaussian whose RuView provenance says `synthetic` is
//! always emitted as `SYNTHETIC`, whatever the caller asks for; the tag can
//! be lowered by the caller, never raised.
